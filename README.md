# Routing Austrian

This repository is the backend code generated by the `equipe-66` team to Hackathon Samba Meets Waltz.

We got the CHALLENGE 3: Talent Search for Microelectronics and Semiconductor Experts

# Why?

All platform should need a backend to structure the data and to keep the bussiness logic.

This backend provide all the necessary data and endpoint to consulting the storage data.

From now we are generating artificial data to allow frontend interact with backend.

# How to use?

You shoud have install the `docker-compose`. You can download [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Execute (in Windows should be `docker compose`):
```
> docker-compose build --no-cache

```

Access [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)

# How to cleanup

Execute (in Windows should be `docker compose`):
```
> docker-compose down
> docker volume rm equipe-66_mysql_data
```

# Next steps

Create the endpoints to create new data
